= Automated Release Note Generation in Azure Pipelines

This document details the automated release note generation for each application upon deployment to an environment.

The link:https://handlebarsjs.com[handlebar] template for release notes can be found in the link:../build/azDevOps/azure/release-notes/publish-release-notes.yml[release notes folder] and can be fully customised.

By default, this will contain the following information:

* Version information and associated pull requests
* Build Scope
** Associated user stories
** Associated bug tickets
* Build Detail
** Test summary
** Commit Log
** Published artifacts
* Rollback steps



[IMPORTANT]
.Linking of work items and pull requests
====
If your repository is hosted in GitHub we recommend following the practices outlined in the Azure DevOps documentation for link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/github/link-to-from-github[linking GitHub commits, pull requests, branches, and issues to work items in Azure Boards] so that work item links can be established during release note generation.
====





== Getting Started

To use this capability, you will need the following marketplace plugins installed:

* link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=richardfennellBM.BM-VSTS-XplatGenerateReleaseNotes[`XplatGenerateReleaseNotes@4`]: This task generates the release notes based on a specified template.
* link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=richardfennellBM.BM-VSTS-WIKIUpdater-Tasks[`WikiUpdaterTask@3`]: This task publishes the generated release notes to a WIKI repository.

=== Enabling Generation

By default, release note generation is disabled due to the plugin requirements. Once these are installed, you can enable release note generation for the desired application pipelines by setting the `enable_release_note_generation` variable to `true`.

This can be found in the `build/azDevOps/azure/ci-vars.yml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
  # Versioning
  - name: enable_release_note_generation
    value: false
----

You will need to manually amend the `build/azDevOps/azure/ci.yml` file with a resource reference to the wiki repository where we will publish the release notes:

[source,yaml]
----
resources:
  repositories:
    - repository: wiki
      type: git
      name: [Insert wiki name, e.g., Stacks.Wiki]
      ref: wikiMaster
----

Note: This should be added to the root level of the pipeline YAML.

== How It Works

When a deployment to either nonprod or prod occurs, we will generate release notes for the applications where release note generation has been enabled.

For example, if a PR is raised triggering a deployment of the `ci-cqrs` application to the nonprod environment, the release note stage will then update a wiki page at the path `Release-Notes/$(core_environment)/$(self_generic_name)/V$(version_major)/V$(version_minor).md`. Any subsequent iterations of a MINOR version will have the release note pre-pended to that same page.

Subsequent deployments for either a new MINOR or MAJOR version will result in a wiki page published to a new page for that `major.minor` version.

Example file structure:

Below is how the `publish-release-notes.yml` template is used in our CI pipeline:

[source,yaml]
----
  - template: release-notes/publish-release-notes.yml
    parameters:
      enable: ${{ variables['enable_release_note_generation'] }}
      runCondition: or(succeeded('Dev'), succeeded('Prod'))
      dependsOnStages:
        - Dev
        - Prod
      environment: $[ coalesce(stageDependencies.Dev.DeployDev.outputs['DeployDev.SetEnv.core_environment'], stageDependencies.Prod.DeployProd.outputs['DeployProd.SetEnv.core_environment']) ]
----

The following parameters are used in the template:

* `enable` (boolean): Determines whether the release note generation is enabled (if false, this stage will not be present in our CI run).
* `runCondition` (object): Specifies the condition under which the release notes stage should run. (This should be the name of the deployment stages.)
* `dependsOnStages` (object): Lists the stages that the release notes stage depends on. (This should be the names of the deployment stages.)
* `environment` (string): Specifies the environment for which the release notes are generated. (Coalesce returns the first non-empty string from the `SetEnv` step within our deployment stages).
