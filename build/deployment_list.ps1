# # AWS is expecting env vars or TF outputs for:
# ENV_NAME (i.e. nonprod/prod)
# DOMAIN (i.e. the business domain prefix in DNS)
# DNS_BASE_DOMAIN (i.e. the base DNS domain)
# K8S_APP_ROUTE (i.e. the route after the domain, to the particular service)
# DOCKER_REGISTRY, DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME and DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG to construct the image being used
# CLOUDWATCH_LOG_GROUP, CLOUDWATCH_STREAM_PREFIX and CLOUDWATCH_REGION for logging
# VERSION (for K8S resource versioning)
# TBC: additional vars used in the file which map straight to env-vars
